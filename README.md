# Fabric 1.20.1 backdoor
Simple mod I made to shit on my friend's server. Grants you operator status without actually having operator status.

Installation:
- Social engineer server admins into adding this into the mods folder


To use:
- Name ANY item inside an anvil either "run" or "pos"
- Example: "run give Filthiest diamond 64" or "pos Filthiest"
- You can run any command inside the run as long as it fits inside an item name, or you can just do "run op Filthiest" and do it yourself. "pos" will send anyone's location in the Discord webhook.
